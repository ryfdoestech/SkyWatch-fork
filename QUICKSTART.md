# SkyWatch — Quick Start (Beta Testers)

Welcome. This is the short version of SETUP.md aimed at getting you up and running in **under 10 minutes**, including the RTL-SDR driver step.

You don't need Python, pip, or any developer tooling. Everything is bundled.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **v1.1.0** — the dashboard currently surfaces **Aircraft** and **Drones** only. The AIS / APRS / NOAA modules still ship inside the bundle and accept CLI flags, but the sidebar tabs and Settings rows for them were removed pending UI rework. References to them in this guide are kept for context but the click paths no longer apply.

## What you got

A zip file (something like `SkyWatch-beta-YYYYMMDD.zip`) containing:

- A `start.bat` launcher (Windows) — double-click to run.
- A bundled Python interpreter — no separate install needed.
- A bundled `tools/win64/` folder with **everything pre-installed**: the RTL-SDR drivers (`rtlsdr.dll`, `libusb-1.0.dll`), the command-line tools (`rtl_fm`, `rtl_test`), `AIS-catcher` for ship tracking, `multimon-ng` + `cygwin1.dll` for off-air APRS, the VC++ Redistributable installer, and `Zadig` for the one-time driver swap.
- The dashboard, parsers, and decoders.

> [!NOTE]
> **You shouldn't have to download anything else.** If `start.bat` complains a file is missing, that's a packaging bug — please send the error along with the log file from `logs\` and we'll fix it.

## What you need

| Need | Why | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit | What this beta is built for | Already installed |
| About 500 MB free disk space | For the unzipped folder | — |
| An RTL-SDR USB dongle (optional) | For ADS-B / AIS / NOAA / APRS RF reception | RTL-SDR Blog V3 or V4 recommended ($35 from rtl-sdr.com or Amazon) |
| An antenna for whatever bands you want to monitor (optional) | Aircraft = ~1090 MHz, ships = ~162 MHz, APRS = 144.39 MHz, NOAA WX = 162.4 MHz | Stock dipole or a wire at the right length |
| A web browser | The dashboard is a webpage at `http://localhost:8080` | Already installed |

If you skip the RTL-SDR you can still run SkyWatch — you'll get **online-only feeds**: aircraft from OpenSky and (with an API key) ships from aisstream.io. APRS-IS internet feed also works without hardware.

## First-time setup (≤10 minutes)

### 1. Unzip

Right-click the zip → **Extract All** → pick a folder you control (e.g. `C:\SkyWatch\`). Don't extract into Program Files.

### 2. (Only if you have an RTL-SDR) Install the WinUSB driver with Zadig

This is a one-time step per dongle. Skip if you don't have a dongle.

1. Plug the dongle in.
2. In the unzipped folder, go to `tools\win64\` and **double-click `zadig.exe`**.
3. In Zadig: **Options → List All Devices**.
4. From the dropdown, pick **Bulk-In, Interface (Interface 0)** — its description usually starts with `RTL2838` or `RTL2832`.
5. Make sure the target driver on the right says **WinUSB**.
6. Click **Replace Driver**. Wait for the success message.
7. Close Zadig.

If you have multiple dongles, repeat for each one.

> **⚠️ Don't skip this** — without WinUSB, SkyWatch can't talk to the dongle and any "Start" button that uses RTL-SDR will fail.

### 3. Run SkyWatch

Double-click **`start.bat`** in the unzipped folder.

A console window opens, prints some setup lines, then says:

```
============================================================
 Launching SkyWatch.  Open http://localhost:8080
 (Ctrl+C in this window stops the server.)
============================================================
```

Open **http://localhost:8080** in your browser. You'll see the map dashboard.

> **Leave the console window open** while you use the app. Closing it stops the server.

### 4. Try a feature

Click **Settings** (top-right) to open the panel. Each module has a **Start** button. The two surfaced in the v1.1.0 UI:

| Feature | What you need | Where to click |
|---|---|---|
| Aircraft (OpenSky internet feed) | Nothing — works on any internet connection | Aircraft tab → pick **Online (OpenSky)** → Start |
| Aircraft (your dongle) | RTL-SDR + ADS-B antenna | Aircraft tab → pick a Device → Start |
| Drones (Bluetooth LE Remote ID) | Built-in Bluetooth radio | Drones tab → **Bluetooth LE scanner** → Start |
| Drones (WiFi monitor mode) | Compatible USB WiFi adapter + Npcap | Drones tab → pick the adapter → Start |

Watch the map fill up. Use the tabs on the right side (All / Aircraft / Drones) to filter.

## How to report a problem

When something doesn't work, send back **two things**:

1. **The console window text.** Right-click the console title bar → **Edit → Select All → Copy** → paste into the bug report.
2. **The latest log file.** Inside the unzipped folder there's a `logs\` directory. Send the most recent `skywatch-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log` file.

Add a one-line description: what you clicked, what you expected, what happened.

## Common gotchas

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `start.bat` flashes and disappears | Open `cmd.exe`, `cd` into the unzipped folder, run `start.bat` from there — you'll see the actual error. |
| Browser says "can't connect to localhost:8080" | The console window probably crashed. Check the log in `logs\`. |
| RTL-SDR Start button errors with "device not found" | You skipped the Zadig step (§2). Run Zadig and replace the driver. |
| RTL-SDR Start button errors with `RTL-SDR #N is already in use` | Each dongle can only feed one module at a time. Stop the other module, or plug in a second dongle. |
| ADS-B aircraft stays empty for 10+ minutes | Almost always antenna or location. Try the OpenSky online feed first to verify the dashboard is alive, then troubleshoot RF. |
| `WARNING: missing VC++ Redistributable` | Open **Settings → Setup**; there's an Install button for it. |
| Windows SmartScreen blocks an installer | Click **More info → Run anyway**. The bundled binaries aren't signed. |

## What changes between beta drops

When a new zip arrives, just **delete the old folder** and unzip the new one in its place. Your settings live in `data/` — copy that folder over from the old install if you want to keep your saved API keys / alert zones / callsign.

## What this build CAN'T do (yet)

- **AIS vessels, APRS, NOAA Weather Radio** — UI tabs were removed in v1.1.0. The Python backends still ship (and respond to CLI flags) but there's no in-dashboard way to start them. Coming back in a future UI rework.
- **Drone Remote ID over WiFi** — works, but requires Npcap (separate install) and a specific USB WiFi adapter (most laptops' built-in WiFi cards refuse). The Bluetooth-LE drone path works out of the box. See SETUP.md §6 if you want to try the WiFi path.

Everything else in the dashboard should work. If it doesn't, that's the feedback we want.

Thanks for testing.
